# Deployment Workflow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üö® DEFAULT: ALWAYS PUSH TO `dev` BRANCH

**NEVER push to `main` unless explicitly instructed!**

- ‚úÖ **Default**: Work on `dev` branch
- ‚úÖ **Default**: Push to `dev` branch
- ‚õî **DANGER**: Only push to `main` when specifically told
- ‚õî **DANGER**: `main` = production = real users see this

---

## Current Setup (October 12, 2025)

### Staging Environment (dev branch)
- **Frontend**: https://jason-coaching-hub-git-dev-creator-economy.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://jason-coaching-backend-staging.up.railway.app
- **Purpose**: Testing, iteration, breaking things safely
- **Database**: Same as production (shared vector store)
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled (`DEBUG_MODE=true`)

### Production Environment (main branch)
- **Frontend**: Your main Vercel domain
- **Backend**: https://jason-coaching-backend-production.up.railway.app
- **Purpose**: Live site for real users
- **Database**: Same as staging (shared vector store)
- **Debug Mode**: Disabled (`DEBUG_MODE=false`)

---

## Your Daily Workflow

### Step 1: Start Working (Always Do This First!)

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# If not on dev, switch to it
git checkout dev

# Get latest changes (if working with others)
git pull origin dev
```

**Remember**: If you're not on `dev`, you're in the wrong place!

### Step 2: Make Changes

- Edit files in Cursor
- Save them
- Test locally if needed (optional)

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "describe what you changed"

# Push to dev (staging)
git push origin dev
```

**What happens**:
- ‚úÖ Vercel automatically deploys frontend to staging URL
- ‚úÖ Railway automatically deploys backend to staging URL
- ‚úÖ Changes are live on staging in ~1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Test on Staging

1. Open: https://jason-coaching-hub-git-dev-creator-economy.vercel.app
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Test all features you changed
5. Send test messages, upload files, etc.

**If broken**: Go back to Step 2, fix it, repeat Steps 3-4

**If working**: Continue to Step 5

### Step 5: Deploy to Production (ONLY WHEN EXPLICITLY TOLD!)

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER ZONE - Only do this when explicitly told!

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge tested changes from dev
git merge dev

# Push to production
git push origin main

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Real users will see these changes immediately!

# Switch back to dev for safety
git checkout dev
```

**What happens**:
- ‚úÖ Vercel automatically deploys frontend to production URL
- ‚úÖ Railway automatically deploys backend to production URL
- üåç **Real users see your changes immediately**

### Step 6: Continue Working

```bash
# Always return to dev branch
git checkout dev
```

**Never** stay on `main` branch!

## Safety Checklist

Before pushing to `main`, verify:

- [ ] Tested on staging thoroughly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] All features working correctly
- [ ] Database changes tested
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Explicitly told to deploy to production
- [ ] Ready for real users to see this

---

## Common Commands

### Check Current Branch
```bash
git branch
# The one with * is your current branch
```

### Switch Branches
```bash
git checkout dev     # Go to dev (do this 99% of the time)
git checkout main    # Go to main (DANGEROUS!)
```

### See What Changed
```bash
git status           # What files changed
git diff             # See exact changes
```

### View Commit History
```bash
git log --oneline    # Recent commits
```

### Undo Last Commit (Keep Changes)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Undo Last Commit (Delete Changes)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

## Emergency: Rolled Out Broken Code

If you accidentally pushed broken code to `main`:

```bash
# Quick rollback
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

This creates a new commit that undoes the last one. Production redeploys automatically with the working version.

## Deployment URLs Reference

| Environment | Frontend | Backend |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Staging (dev)** | https://jason-coaching-hub-git-dev-creator-economy.vercel.app | https://jason-coaching-backend-staging.up.railway.app |
| **Production (main)** | Your main domain | https://jason-coaching-backend-production.up.railway.app |
| **Local** | http://localhost:5173 | http://localhost:8000 |

## How Auto-Deployment Works

### When you push to `dev`:

```
Your Push ‚Üí GitHub (dev branch)
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Vercel sees push ‚Üí builds frontend ‚Üí deploys to staging URL
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Railway sees push ‚Üí builds backend ‚Üí deploys to staging URL
```

**Time**: ~1-2 minutes

### When you push to `main`:

```
Your Push ‚Üí GitHub (main branch)
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Vercel sees push ‚Üí builds frontend ‚Üí deploys to PRODUCTION
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Railway sees push ‚Üí builds backend ‚Üí deploys to PRODUCTION
```

**Time**: ~1-2 minutes
**Impact**: üåç Real users see changes

## Environment Variables

### Staging (Vercel Preview)
- `VITE_API_BASE_1`: Points to staging Railway backend
- `VITE_CHATKIT_API_DOMAIN_KEY`: Your domain key

### Production (Vercel Production)
- `VITE_API_BASE`: Points to production Railway backend
- `VITE_CHATKIT_API_DOMAIN_KEY`: Your domain key

### Staging Backend (Railway)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI key
- `JASON_VECTOR_STORE_ID`: Your vector store ID
- `DEBUG_MODE`: `true`

### Production Backend (Railway)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI key
- `JASON_VECTOR_STORE_ID`: Your vector store ID
- `DEBUG_MODE`: `false`

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Which branch am I on?"
```bash
git branch
```
Look for the `*` - that's your current branch.

### "I made changes on main by accident!"
```bash
git stash                # Save changes
git checkout dev         # Switch to dev
git stash pop            # Restore changes
```

### "My changes aren't showing on staging"
1. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
2. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
3. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check git push actually succeeded: `git log origin/dev`

### "I pushed to main by accident!"
```bash
git checkout main
git revert HEAD          # Undo the commit
git push origin main     # Redeploy without broken code
git checkout dev         # Go back to safety
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always work on `dev`** - 99% of your time should be on dev branch
2. **Test thoroughly on staging** - Catch bugs before production
3. **Commit frequently** - Small commits are easier to debug
4. **Descriptive commit messages** - Future you will thank you
5. **Only merge to main when explicitly told** - Protect production
6. **Immediately switch back to dev** - Don't linger on main

---

## Quick Reference

**The Three Commands You'll Use Most:**

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're on dev
git checkout dev

# 2. Deploy to staging
git add . && git commit -m "your message" && git push origin dev

# 3. Check which branch you're on
git branch
```

**That's 90% of what you'll do!**

---

## Summary

### The Golden Rule

```
Work on dev ‚Üí Push to dev ‚Üí Test on staging ‚Üí Only merge to main when told
```

### The Safety Rule

**üö® DEFAULT = `dev` branch**

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise, you should be:
- ‚úÖ Working on `dev`
- ‚úÖ Pushing to `dev`
- ‚úÖ Testing on staging

Never touch `main` unless specifically told!
