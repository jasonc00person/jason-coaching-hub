# ChatKit Upgrade Research Summary
**Comprehensive Analysis & Fix**

## 🎯 TL;DR - The Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Your app has a **blank screen** because you have two versions of ChatKit installed:
- `@openai/chatkit@1.0.0` (doesn't officially exist)
- `@openai/chatkit@0.0.0` (from `@openai/chatkit-react` dependency)

### The Solution
**Remove the direct `@openai/chatkit` dependency** from `package.json`. Only use `@openai/chatkit-react`.

### The Fix
```bash
./fix-chatkit.sh
```

## 📊 What We Discovered

### Official OpenAI ChatKit Versions (Verified)

I cloned and analyzed the official OpenAI sample repo: `openai/openai-chatkit-advanced-samples`

**Backend (Python):**
```toml
openai-chatkit==0.0.2  
# Published: Oct 6, 2025
# Source: PyPI
```

**Frontend (npm):**
```json
"@openai/chatkit-react": "^0"
# Resolves to: 0.0.0
# NO separate @openai/chatkit dependency
```

### What Doesn't Exist

**Version 1.0.0/1.0.1 is NOT published:**
- Not in official OpenAI samples
- Not in PyPI (backend)
- Not confirmed in npm (frontend)
- Might be internal/beta/unreleased

**There's a different "ChatKit" product:**
- `egoist/chatkit-docs` (community project)
- Different product entirely
- **NOT related to OpenAI's ChatKit**

---

## 🔍 Research Journey

### What You Found (And What It Means)

1. **GitHub Tag v1.0.1**
   - You found a tag in GitHub repo
   - But NOT published to PyPI/npm
   - Source code ≠ published package

2. **Official Samples Repo**
   - Uses `openai-chatkit>=0.0.2`
   - Uses `@openai/chatkit-react: ^0`
   - **Does NOT use separate `@openai/chatkit`**

3. **ChatKit Python SDK Docs**
   - Shows `stream_agent_response` (you use this ✅)
   - Shows `ProgressUpdateEvent` support
   - But docs might be ahead of published packages

4. **AgentKit Mentions**
   - New OpenAI product (announced recently)
   - Built on top of ChatKit
   - Future direction for agent tooling
   - Not relevant to your current issue

5. **egoist/chatkit-docs**
   - **Different product!**
   - Community project
   - Not OpenAI's ChatKit
   - Ignore this for your use case

### Key Insight

**Docs and GitHub repos often show unreleased features.** The only reliable source of truth is:
1. What's actually published (PyPI, npm)
2. What the official samples use
3. What gets installed when you run `npm install`

## 🛠️ Your Current State vs. Official Sample

### Frontend Comparison

| Package | Your App | Official Sample | Status |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| `@openai/chatkit` | `^1.0.0` | ❌ Not used | ❌ Remove this |
| `@openai/chatkit-react` | `^0` | `^0` | ✅ Correct |
| React | `^19.2.0` | `^19.2.0` | ✅ Correct |

### Backend Comparison

| Package | Your App | Official Sample | Status |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| `openai-chatkit` | `>=0.1.0` | `>=0.0.2` | ⚠️ Update to 0.0.2 |
| `openai-agents` | `>=0.3.3` | (latest) | ✅ Good |
| `openai` | `>=1.107.1` | `>=1.40` | ✅ Good |

### Component Features Comparison

| Feature | Your Code | Official Sample | v0.0.0 Support |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Basic chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| Streaming | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| File search tool | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| Web search tool | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Yes |
| Image attachments | ✅ | ❌ | ❓ Unknown |
| `uploadStrategy` | ✅ | ❌ | ❓ Unknown |
| `widgets.onAction` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ Probably not |
| `entities.onTagSearch` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ Probably not |
| `onClientTool` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ Probably not |
| `ProgressUpdateEvent` | ✅ | ❌ | ❓ Unknown |

**Your component is MORE advanced** than the official sample. Some features might not work in v0.0.0.

## 📋 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Version Conflict (15 min)
**Goal:** Get ChatKit UI to appear (not blank)

1. Run `./fix-chatkit.sh`
2. Verify single version installed
3. Test basic message: "Hello"
4. Check if UI renders

**Success = No blank screen**

### Phase 2: Test Core Features (30 min)
**Goal:** Verify tools and streaming work

1. Test file search: "What are your hook templates?"
2. Test web search: "What's trending today?"
3. Test streaming: Long response
4. Check backend logs for tool execution

**Success = Tools work, responses stream**

### Phase 3: Test Advanced Features (1 hour)
**Goal:** See what works from your advanced component

Test one at a time:
1. Image uploads
2. Widget interactions
3. Entity tagging
4. Client tools
5. Progress events

**For each:** If it breaks, comment it out temporarily.

### Phase 4: Incremental Enhancement (As needed)
**Goal:** Add features back gradually

1. Start with minimal ChatKitPanel
2. Add one feature
3. Test
4. If works → keep it
5. If breaks → investigate or skip
6. Repeat

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Immediate Test (After Fix)

```bash
# 1. Run fix
./fix-chatkit.sh

# 2. Check versions
cd frontend-v2
npm list @openai/chatkit
# Should show: @openai/chatkit-react@0.0.0
#               └── @openai/chatkit@0.0.0

# 3. Start servers
# Terminal 1:
cd backend-v2
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2:
cd frontend-v2
npm run dev

# 4. Open browser
open http://localhost:5173

# 5. Send test message
# Type: "Hello"
# Expected: Response appears, no blank screen
```

### Browser Checks

**Console (F12):**
```
✅ Should see: [ChatKitPanel] Control: ✅ Ready
❌ Should NOT see: "Cannot read property..."
❌ Should NOT see: "Module not found"
```

**Network (F12 → Network):**
```
✅ POST /chatkit → 200 OK
✅ Content-Type: text/event-stream
✅ Response streaming (multiple data: events)
```

### Backend Checks

**Terminal output:**
```
✅ [ChatKit] Processing request for session: ...
✅ [Stream Start] Thread: ...
✅ Tool execution logs (if using tools)
❌ No Python tracebacks
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Matrix

### Issue: Still Blank Screen

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Multiple versions still installed**
   ```bash
   npm list @openai/chatkit
   # If you see 1.0.0 anywhere → not fixed
   # Solution: Re-run fix script
   ```

2. **Cache not cleared**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .vite dist
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

3. **Component using unsupported features**
   ```bash
   # Test with minimal component
   # See FINAL_FIX_GUIDE.md for minimal code
   ```

### Issue: Console Errors

**"Cannot read property 'control' of undefined"**
→ ChatKit not initializing
→ Check API URL and domain key

**"Module not found: @openai/chatkit"**
→ Import error
→ Should import from `@openai/chatkit-react` only

**"Failed to fetch"**
→ Backend not running or wrong URL
→ Check backend is on port 8000

### Issue: No Streaming

**Backend logs show events but UI doesn't update**
→ Event format mismatch
→ Try removing ProgressUpdateEvent code

**Network shows no SSE connection**
→ CORS issue or endpoint wrong
→ Check /chatkit endpoint exists

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### Version Management

1. **Don't trust version numbers in docs** - verify what's published
2. **Use official samples as baseline** - they're tested
3. **Pin versions during development** - avoid surprises
4. **Test incrementally** - don't change everything at once

### Debugging Strategy

1. **Start minimal** - remove features until it works
2. **Compare with samples** - diff your code vs. official
3. **Check what's actually installed** - not what you think you have
4. **Log everything** - events, versions, state

### Package Management

1. **Peer dependencies matter** - don't override them
2. **Cache can lie** - clean it when in doubt
3. **Lock files are truth** - check them when confused
4. **Multiple versions = trouble** - npm list is your friend
