# Chat History Changes - Session-Based Solution

## Overview
Converted the chat system from persistent server-side storage to a simple session-based approach where chat history is temporary and browser-based.

## What Changed

### Backend Changes (`backend-v2/app/memory_store.py`)
- **Removed file persistence**: The `MemoryStore` no longer saves threads to `threads.json`
- **Removed `_load_from_file()` and `_save_to_file()` methods**
- **Simplified constructor**: No longer accepts or uses a `persist_file` parameter
- **Result**: Threads are now stored only in backend memory, cleared when server restarts

### Frontend Changes (`frontend-v2/src/components/ChatKitPanel.tsx`)
- **Removed invalid configuration options** that were causing TypeScript errors
- **Cleaned up**: Simplified the ChatKit configuration

### CSS Changes (`frontend-v2/src/index.css`)
- **Added CSS rules** to hide thread history/switcher UI elements
- **Hides**: Thread switcher buttons, sidebar, and any history-related UI components

### Cleanup
- **Deleted `threads.json`**: No longer needed since we're not persisting to disk

## How It Works Now

### For Each User Session:
1. User visits the site and starts a chat
2. ChatKit creates a new thread automatically
3. The thread is stored in the backend's memory (RAM only)
4. User can chat normally within their session
5. **When user refreshes**: They start a fresh conversation
6. **No login required**: Each visitor gets an independent experience
7. **No shared history**: Users don't see each other's chats

### Key Benefits:
- ✅ **Simple**: No database, no authentication, no persistent storage
- ✅ **Private**: Each user's chat is isolated
- ✅ **Clean UI**: No confusing thread history buttons or sidebars
- ✅ **Fresh Start**: Every page refresh gives a new conversation
- ✅ **Publicly Accessible**: Anyone can use it without signing up

## Technical Details

### Backend Storage
- Threads stored in Python dictionary in memory
- Automatically cleaned when backend restarts
- Multiple concurrent users supported (each gets their own thread)

### Frontend Behavior
- Thread history UI is hidden via CSS
- Each page load shows a fresh chat interface
- No localStorage or sessionStorage for history (intentionally)

## Testing
To verify the changes work correctly:
1. Start the backend server
2. Open the frontend in a browser
3. Have a conversation
4. Refresh the page → You should see a fresh chat
5. Open in another browser/tab → Independent chat session

## Reverting (if needed)
If you need to go back to persistent storage:
1. Restore the `_load_from_file()` and `_save_to_file()` methods
2. Update `__init__` to accept `persist_file` parameter
3. Call `self._save_to_file()` in `save_thread()` and `delete_thread()`
4. Remove the CSS rules hiding thread history UI
