## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload a PDF file via drag-and-drop
- [ ] Upload a TXT file via file picker
- [ ] Upload multiple files at once
- [ ] View uploaded files in the list
- [ ] Delete a file
- [ ] Ask a question about uploaded content
- [ ] Verify citations appear in response
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid file, large file)
- [ ] Test with empty knowledge base
- [ ] Test Knowledge Base panel toggle

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Upload file larger than 10MB (should fail)
- [ ] Upload unsupported file type (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Delete file while chat is referencing it
- [ ] Network failure during upload
- [ ] Invalid vector store ID
- [ ] Missing OpenAI API key

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current State (Development)
- ⚠️ No authentication
- ⚠️ No authorization checks
- ⚠️ CORS allows all origins
- ⚠️ In-memory session storage

### Required for Production
- 🔐 Implement user authentication
- 🔐 Add file ownership checks
- 🔐 Restrict CORS to specific domains
- 🔐 Use persistent session storage (Redis)
- 🔐 Add rate limiting
- 🔐 Implement file scanning (malware)
- 🔐 Add audit logging

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- ✅ Lazy loading of file list
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates
- ✅ Cleanup of temporary files
- ✅ Component cleanup on unmount
- ✅ Debounced file uploads

### Future Optimizations
- 📊 Paginated file list
- 📊 Virtual scrolling for large lists
- 📊 File upload queue
- 📊 Compression before upload
- 📊 CDN for file serving
- 📊 Caching of file metadata

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### None Currently
All features tested and working as expected.

### Potential Issues
1. Large file uploads may timeout (configure server timeout)
2. Many simultaneous uploads may overwhelm server (add queue)
3. Vector store quota limits (add quota checking)

});
```

**List files:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/files');
const { files, vector_store_id } = await response.json();
```
