# Vercel Deployment Checklist 

## ‚úÖ What We've Done:
1. Created `/api` folder with Python backend
2. Fixed `vercel.json` configuration
3. Pushed changes to GitHub (commit: `f5d7c47`)

## üîç Manual Steps Needed:

### Step 1: Check GitHub Webhook
1. Go to: https://github.com/jasonc00person/jason-coaching-hub/settings/hooks
2. Look for a Vercel webhook
3. If missing:
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Click "Git" section
   - Disconnect and reconnect the repository

### Step 2: Verify Email Match
Your git commits are using: `jasoncooperson@Mac.attlocal.net`
This might not match your GitHub email!

**Fix it:**
```bash
git config --global user.email "your-github-email@example.com"
```

### Step 3: Manual Deploy (If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Work)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/creator-economy/jason-coaching-hub
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click the three dots (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢) on any deployment
4. Click "Redeploy"
5. Or click "Deploy" button and select `main` branch

### Step 4: Check Functions After Deploy
1. Go to: Project Settings ‚Üí Functions
2. You should see: `/api/index.py` listed
3. If not, the Python backend won't work

## üéØ Expected Result:
Once deployed, the following should work:
- Frontend: `https://jason-coaching-hub.vercel.app/`
- API Health: `https://jason-coaching-hub.vercel.app/api/health`
- ChatKit: `https://jason-coaching-hub.vercel.app/api/chatkit`

## üêõ If Deployment Fails:

### Check Build Logs:
1. Go to failed deployment
2. Click "View Function Logs"
3. Look for errors in the build process

### Common Issues:
- **Python dependency errors**: Check `/api/requirements.txt`
- **Import errors**: Check that `/api/index.py` can import from `main.py`
- **Missing environment variables**: Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `JASON_VECTOR_STORE_ID` are set

## üìû Next Steps:

1. **Refresh Vercel Deployments** page - Look for new deployment
2. **If no deployment appears in 2-3 minutes**: Manually trigger via Vercel dashboard
3. **Once deployed**: Test the chat at your Vercel URL
4. **If chat doesn't work**: Check browser console for errors
