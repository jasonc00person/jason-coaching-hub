# Blank Screen Debugging Guide

## Facts Established

1. ✅ **Backend is WORKING on Railway**
   - Successfully installs `openai-chatkit-1.0.1` (Python 3.13)
   - Deploys without errors
   - Has been working this whole time

2. ✅ **Frontend 0.0.0 works** (current version after rollback)
   - Connects to Railway backend successfully
   - Everything functions properly

3. ❌ **Frontend 1.1.0 causes blank screen**
   - Upgraded from `@openai/chatkit-react` 0.0.0 → 1.1.0
   - Build succeeds on Vercel
   - Runtime blank screen

## Possible Causes

### 1. Breaking API Changes Between 0.0.0 and 1.1.0

**Pre-release (0.0.0)** and **stable (1.1.0)** may have different:
- API contracts
- Event names
- Configuration options
- Expected backend responses

### 2. Backend Version Mismatch

- Frontend 1.1.0 might expect backend features from `openai-chatkit 1.1.x` 
- But Railway has `openai-chatkit 1.0.1`
- Version mismatch could cause silent failures

### 3. Runtime JavaScript Errors

The blank screen could be caused by:
- Uncaught exceptions in ChatKit 1.1.0
- Initialization failures
- Missing required configuration

### 4. CORS or Network Issues

- Different request format in 1.1.0
- Headers or authentication changes
- Domain key validation changes

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

When you upgraded to 1.1.0 and got the blank screen, did you check the browser console for errors?

**Expected errors might be:**
- `Uncaught TypeError: ...`
- `Failed to fetch...`
- `ChatKit initialization error`
- Network errors in Network tab

### Step 2: Check Network Tab

In the blank screen state:
- Are requests being made to Railway backend?
- What's the response status? (200, 401, 403, 500?)
- Are there CORS errors?

### Step 3: Test Backend Directly

Your backend is at: `https://jason-coaching-backend-production.up.railway.app/`

Test endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://jason-coaching-backend-production.up.railway.app/health

# Root endpoint
curl https://jason-coaching-backend-production.up.railway.app/
```

### Step 4: Gradual Upgrade

Instead of jumping to 1.1.0, try intermediate versions:
```bash
npm install @openai/chatkit-react@1.0.0
# Test
npm install @openai/chatkit-react@1.1.0
# Test
```

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the changelog pattern (0.0.0 → 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 released in 2 days), this was likely a **rapid pre-release → stable transition**.

The 0.0.0 pre-release probably has a **different API contract** than stable 1.x versions.

**Common breaking changes in such transitions:**
1. Configuration option names
2. Authentication method
3. Event names
4. Required vs optional props
5. Return value formats

## Recommendation

### Option A: Stay on 0.0.0 (Current State)
- ✅ Working now
- ✅ Stable
- ❌ No tool visualization
- ❌ Pre-release version

### Option B: Debug the 1.1.0 Issue
1. Deploy frontend 1.1.0 again
2. Open browser dev tools IMMEDIATELY
3. Capture console errors
4. Capture network errors
5. Share those errors to fix the issue

### Option C: Upgrade Backend First
Since Railway is on `openai-chatkit 1.0.1`, check if there's a newer version:
```python
# In requirements.txt
openai-chatkit>=1.1.0  # Try newer version
```

Then upgrade frontend to match.

### Option D: Check for Migration Guide

Look for official migration documentation:
- https://openai.github.io/chatkit-js/ (check for "Migration" or "Changelog")
- https://github.com/openai/chatkit-js/releases
- Release notes between 0.0.0 and 1.1.0

## Next Steps

1. **Capture the actual error** - Deploy 1.1.0 again and screenshot console errors
2. **Check backend logs** - See if Railway shows any errors when frontend 1.1.0 connects
3. **Compare configurations** - See if 1.1.0 requires different config

The blank screen is hiding the real error. We need to see what's actually failing!
