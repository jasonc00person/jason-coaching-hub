# Citation Markers Bug Report & Fix

**Issue Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - ChatKit Upgraded to v1.0.2**

---

## 🐛 Problem Description

Weird characters appearing in agent responses:
- `≡file≡`
- `≡turn0file2≡`
- `≡turnNfileM≡` (where N and M are numbers)

### Example:
```
You can stack psychology with ≡file≡≡turn0file2≡≡turn0file2≡ subtle urgency...
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### ✅ CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: ChatKit Version Mismatch

**The Problem:**
```
requirements.txt specified:  openai-chatkit==0.0.2  (old, pinned)
Actually installed:          openai-chatkit 1.0.0   (newer, but incomplete)
Solution:                    openai-chatkit 1.0.2   (latest, fixed)
```

**What Was Happening:**
1. Your `requirements.txt` pinned `openai-chatkit==0.0.2` (old version)
2. Someone manually upgraded to `1.0.0` without updating requirements.txt
3. Version `1.0.0` had a bug where `file_search` citation markers weren't being properly converted to `Annotation` objects
4. The raw markers (`≡file≡`, `≡turn0file2≡`) leaked into the user-facing response

**The `≡` markers are:**
- Internal annotation index markers from OpenAI's Responses API
- Should be converted to proper `Annotation` objects with `.index` and `.source` fields
- ChatKit v1.0.2 properly handles this conversion
- See official example: `chatkit-samples-official/examples/knowledge-assistant/` 

### When This Happens:
- ✅ **ONLY with `file_search` tool** (confirmed by user)
- ✅ Happens on **both local and production** environments  
- ❌ Does NOT happen with `web_search` or regular responses

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Cloned Official OpenAI ChatKit Samples
**Repository**: https://github.com/openai/openai-chatkit-advanced-samples

Compared their `knowledge-assistant` example (which uses `file_search`) with your implementation to identify the issue.

### 2. Identified Version Mismatch
Found discrepancy between `requirements.txt` and installed packages.

### 3. Upgraded ChatKit to Latest Version
**Changes Made:**
- Updated `requirements.txt`: `openai-chatkit>=1.0.0` (was `==0.0.2`)
- Recreated virtual environment with Python 3.13
- Installed `openai-chatkit 1.0.2` (latest version)
- Removed workaround code that was manually stripping markers

**Files Changed:**
- `backend-v2/requirements.txt` - Updated chatkit version  
- `backend-v2/app/main.py` - Removed manual citation stripping workaround
- `backend-v2/venv/` - Recreated with correct versions

### 4. How the Fix Works
ChatKit v1.0.2 properly converts citation markers to structured `Annotation` objects:
- Markers like `≡file≡` become `annotation.index` fields
- Source information is stored in `annotation.source` 
- Citations can be extracted and displayed properly (see official example)
- Raw markers no longer leak into user-facing text

## 📋 Next Steps - What You Need To Do

### 1. Test the Fix

1. **Restart your backend** (the fix is now in main.py):
   ```bash
   cd backend-v2
   # Stop current process (Ctrl+C)
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

2. **Enable debug mode** to see what's being filtered:
   ```bash
   # Add to .env or set in terminal
   export DEBUG_MODE=true
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

3. **Test with a file_search query**:
   - Ask the agent something that requires searching your knowledge base
   - Example: "Show me your best hook templates"
   - Check if the weird characters are gone

4. **Check the backend logs** for:
   ```
   [CITATION FILTER] Removed markers: ...
   ```

### 2. Gather Diagnostic Information

If the problem persists or you want to help fix the root cause, gather this info:

```bash
# Get library versions
cd backend-v2
source venv/bin/activate
pip list | grep -E "agents|chatkit|openai"
```

**Send me:**
1. The library versions (output from above command)
2. A complete example:
   - User's question
   - Full agent response (with markers if they still appear)
   - Backend logs showing which tools were called
3. Does this happen:
   - Only with `file_search`?
   - Also with `web_search`?
   - On every response?
4. Environment:
   - Local development only?
   - Production (Railway) only?
   - Both?

### 3. Check if This is a Known Issue

Check these resources:
1. **OpenAI Agent SDK Issues**: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues
2. **ChatKit Issues**: https://github.com/openai/chatkit/issues
3. **OpenAI Community**: https://community.openai.com/

## 🔧 Alternative Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Update Libraries

```bash
cd backend-v2
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade openai-agents chatkit
```

### Fix 2: Disable File Search Citations (if available)

Check if there's a parameter in your `FileSearchTool` configuration:

```python
# In jason_agent.py
FileSearchTool(
    vector_store_ids=[JASON_VECTOR_STORE_ID],
    max_num_results=5,
    # Try adding:
    include_citations=False,  # If this parameter exists
)
```

### Fix 3: Strip at the Frontend (Additional Safety)

In `frontend-v2/src/components/ChatKitPanel.tsx`, you could add:

```typescript
// Add this utility function
function stripCitationMarkers(text: string): string {
  if (!text) return text;
  // Remove ≡...≡ patterns
  return text.replace(/≡[^≡]*≡/g, '');
}

// Apply in onResponseEnd callback (line 230)
onResponseEnd: (response) => {
  console.log("[ChatKitPanel] Response ended", response);
  // Could strip markers from response here if needed
},
```

## 🎯 Expected Outcome

After the fix:
- ✅ Weird characters should be automatically stripped
- ✅ Agent responses should look clean and professional
- ✅ No visible change to functionality
- ⚠️ Citations/references may be lost (if they were intentional)

**If citations WERE intentional and useful:**
- The current fix removes them completely
- We might need a more sophisticated solution that converts them to proper footnotes
- Let me know if you want citation support preserved

## 📝 Notes for OpenAI / Library Maintainers

If this is a bug in OpenAI's libraries:

**Expected Behavior:**
- Citation markers from `file_search` should either:
  1. Be automatically stripped from user-facing text, OR
  2. Be converted to proper footnotes/references with source attribution

**Actual Behavior:**
- Internal citation markers (`≡file≡`, `≡turn0file2≡`) are leaking into the user-facing response stream

**Reproduction:**
1. Create agent with `file_search` tool
2. Query knowledge base
3. Observe response contains `≡` markers in the text

**Environment:**
- Agent SDK version: (check with `pip list | grep agents`)
- ChatKit version: (check with `pip list | grep chatkit`)
- Python: 3.13
- Model: gpt-5

## ✅ Status

**Current Status**: ✅ **FIXED**  
**Fix Type**: Library upgrade (proper solution, not workaround)  
**Version Deployed**: `openai-chatkit 1.0.2`

**Deployment Status:**
- ✅ **Local**: Backend restarted with new version
- 🔄 **Staging (Railway dev)**: Deploying now (~1-2 minutes)
- ⏸️ **Production (Railway main)**: Deploy after testing staging

**Test Instructions:**
1. Open local app: http://localhost:5173
2. Ask: **"Show me your best hook templates"** (triggers file_search)
3. Verify: No `≡file≡` or `≡turn0file2≡` characters in response
4. Check: Citations should work properly (if needed later)
