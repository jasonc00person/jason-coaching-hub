# ChatKit Upgrade Guide
## Investigation Results & Action Plan

**Last Updated:** October 9, 2025

---

## 🔍 Current Situation

### Frontend Status
- **Current:** `@openai/chatkit-react` v0.0.0 (pre-release)
- **Available:** `@openai/chatkit-react` v1.1.0 (stable, released Oct 8, 2025)
- **Backend:** Python using OpenAI Agents SDK v0.3.3

### ❌ Critical Issue Discovered

**Your backend is completely broken and cannot start!**

```python
# These imports in backend-v2/app/main.py FAIL:
from chatkit.agents import AgentContext, stream_agent_response  # ❌ Module not found
from chatkit.server import ChatKitServer, StreamingResult       # ❌ Module not found
from chatkit.types import (...)                                  # ❌ Module not found
```

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chatkit'`

The `openai-chatkit` 0.0.1 package you have installed is just a placeholder - it contains no actual code.

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

Your code was written for a Python ChatKit SDK that either:
1. **Doesn't exist yet** (pre-release documentation)
2. **Has a different package name**
3. **Is part of a newer `openai-agents` version** that isn't released yet

The backend code structure suggests it was created from OpenAI documentation or examples that reference future/unreleased features.

---

## 📊 Why the Frontend Upgrade Failed

When you upgraded `@openai/chatkit-react` from 0.0.0 → 1.1.0:
1. ✅ Frontend package installed successfully
2. ✅ Build completed without errors
3. ❌ **Runtime:** Frontend tried to connect to backend `/chatkit` endpoint
4. ❌ **Backend:** Can't start due to import errors
5. ❌ **Result:** Blank screen (no backend to serve requests)

---

## ✅ Solutions

You have **three options** to fix this:

### Option 1: Roll Back Frontend (Quick Fix) ✨ **RECOMMENDED FOR NOW**

Stay on the working pre-release version until the Python ChatKit SDK is officially released.

```bash
cd frontend-v2
# Revert to working version
npm install @openai/chatkit-react@^0
```

**Status:** ✅ Your current setup (0.0.0) works because it's compatible with your custom backend implementation.

---

### Option 2: Rewrite Backend Without ChatKit SDK (Medium Effort)

Remove the non-existent `chatkit` imports and implement a custom backend that speaks ChatKit's protocol directly.

**Required Changes:**
1. Remove all `from chatkit.*` imports
2. Implement custom ChatKit protocol handlers
3. Use `openai-agents` SDK directly
4. Create custom streaming endpoints matching ChatKit's expected format

**Pros:**
- Full control over implementation
- Can upgrade frontend to latest version
- No waiting for official Python SDK

**Cons:**
- Requires reverse-engineering ChatKit protocol
- More maintenance burden
- May break with future ChatKit updates

---

### Option 3: Wait for Official Python ChatKit SDK (No Effort)

Wait for OpenAI to release the official Python ChatKit SDK that your code expects.

**Indicators:**
- Your code structure matches unreleased documentation patterns
- The `openai-chatkit` PyPI package is just a placeholder (0.0.1)
- Recent Agent SDK/ChatKit releases (Oct 6-8, 2025) suggest rapid development

**Recommendation:** Check [openai.github.io/chatkit-python](https://openai.github.io/chatkit-python/) periodically

---

## 🔧 Immediate Action: Verify Backend Status

First, let's confirm your backend is actually running:

```bash
cd backend-v2
python3 -c "from app.main import app"
```

If this fails (which it will), you need to either:
1. Fix the imports
2. Find the correct Python package
3. Revert to a working backend version

---

## 📚 What the Documentation Says

### Frontend (JavaScript/React)
According to [ChatKit docs](https://openai.github.io/chatkit-js/):
- ✅ ChatKit 1.x **automatically** visualizes tool calls
- ✅ Works with OpenAI Agents SDK
- ✅ Built-in streaming, widgets, tool visualization
- ✅ No code changes needed for basic tool visualization

### Backend (Python)
- 🔍 Documentation references exist but implementation unclear
- 🔍 `chatkit-python` mentioned but package not found on PyPI
- 🔍 Your code structure suggests unreleased SDK

---

## 🎨 Tool Visualization

### What You Should Get (When Fixed)

When properly configured with ChatKit 1.x:
1. **🔧 Tool Call Indicators** - Shows which tool is being called
2. **📝 Parameters** - Displays arguments passed to tools
3. **⏳ Execution Status** - Loading state while tool runs
4. **✅ Results** - Shows tool output
5. **🧠 Chain-of-Thought** - Agent reasoning process

### Your Current Tools
- **File Search** - Searches your knowledge base (vector store)
- **Web Search** - Real-time web searches

These SHOULD automatically visualize in ChatKit 1.x, but only if backend works!

---

## 💡 Recommended Path Forward

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ **Revert frontend to v0.0.0** (working version)
   ```bash
   cd frontend-v2
   git checkout HEAD~1 package.json package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. ✅ **Test backend actually works**
   ```bash
   cd backend-v2
   python3 -c "from app.main import app; print('Backend OK')"
   ```

### Short Term (This Week)
1. 🔍 **Investigate backend source**
   - Where did this code come from?
   - Was it generated from a template?
   - Is there a working version in git history?

2. 🔍 **Check for Python ChatKit updates**
   - Monitor `openai-agents` package updates
   - Check OpenAI developer forums
   - Look for `chatkit-python` or similar packages

### Long Term (When SDK Released)
1. ✅ Upgrade to official Python ChatKit SDK
2. ✅ Upgrade frontend to ChatKit 1.x
3. ✅ Get automatic tool visualization

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once you have a working setup:

- [ ] Backend starts without import errors
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend
- [ ] Can send messages and get responses  
- [ ] File search tool works
- [ ] Web search tool works
- [ ] Tool calls appear in UI (if ChatKit 1.x)
- [ ] No blank screens
- [ ] No console errors

---

## 📞 Getting Help

If you need to fix the backend immediately:
1. Share where the backend code came from
2. Check if there's a git history with a working version
3. Consider creating a minimal custom backend
4. Reach out to OpenAI support about Python ChatKit SDK status

## Summary

**Bottom Line:** Your backend has never worked with the current code. The frontend upgrade exposed this issue by attempting to connect. Revert to the working frontend version (0.0.0) and investigate the backend source/history to find a working version or wait for the official Python ChatKit SDK release.
