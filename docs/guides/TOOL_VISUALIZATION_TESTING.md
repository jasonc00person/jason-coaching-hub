# Tool Visualization Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

We've added real-time tool progress visualization to show users when the agent is actively using tools like file search, web search, or image analysis.

### Backend Changes

**File: `backend-v2/app/main.py`**

1. **Import ProgressUpdateEvent** (lines 23-27)
   - Imported with fallback if not available in the ChatKit version

2. **Added Tool Progress Helper** (lines 66-83)
   - `_get_tool_progress_message()` method maps tool names to user-friendly messages:
     - `file_search` â†’ "Searching knowledge base..."
     - `web_search` â†’ "Searching the web..."
     - Generic fallback for unknown tools

3. **Event Logging & Debugging** (lines 148-174)
   - Added comprehensive event logging to see what ChatKit is emitting
   - Logs all events with their types
   - Special logging for tool-related events
   - Passes all events through to ChatKit's automatic visualization

### How It Works

The implementation leverages ChatKit's built-in tool visualization:

1. **Agents SDK** emits events when tools are called (Runner.run_streamed)
2. **stream_agent_response** converts Agents SDK events to ChatKit events
3. **ChatKit UI** automatically renders tool progress in the interface
4. **Logging** helps us verify which events are being emitted

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Deploy the Changes

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/jasoncooperson/Documents/Agent\ Builder\ Demo\ 2
git add -A
git commit -m "Add tool visualization with event logging"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Test File Search Tool

**Action:** Send a message that triggers file search

**Example messages:**
- "search your knowledge base for hook templates"
- "show me your templates"
- "what frameworks do you have"

**Expected behavior:**
- Before response: See "Searching knowledge base..." or similar progress indicator
- ChatKit UI should show an animated indicator
- After completion: See the actual response with search results

### 3. Test Web Search Tool

**Action:** Send a message that triggers web search

**Example messages:**
- "what's trending on TikTok right now"
- "find the latest Instagram algorithm updates"
- "search for viral content trends"

**Expected behavior:**
- Before response: See "Searching the web..." or similar progress indicator
- Should show different indicator than file search
- After completion: See response with current web data

### 4. Test Image Analysis

**Action:** Upload an image and ask about it

**Expected behavior:**
- When image is being analyzed: See progress indicator
- After analysis: See feedback on the image

### 5. Check Server Logs

**In Railway dashboard:**
- View deployment logs
- Look for `[Event]`, `[Tool Event]`, and `[Tool]` log entries
- These logs show exactly what events are being emitted

**What to look for:**
```
[Event] ThreadStreamEvent: tool_call_started
[Tool Event] Type: tool_call_started, Event: ...
[Tool] Detected tool: file_search
```

## Troubleshooting

### If tool progress is NOT showing in UI:

1. **Check logs** - Are tool events being emitted?
   - YES â†’ ChatKit should be showing them (check ChatKit version)
   - NO â†’ Need to emit custom events

2. **Check ChatKit version** - Tool visualization may require specific version
   - Run `pip show openai-chatkit` in Railway

3. **Frontend console** - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for ChatKit logs about tool events
   - Check for any errors

### If progress shows but messages are generic:

The helper method `_get_tool_progress_message` contains the custom messages. You can add more:

```python
tool_messages = {
    "file_search": {
        "running": "Your custom message...",
        "completed": "Search complete!"
    },
    # Add more tools here
}
```

## Next Steps (If Needed)

If automatic visualization doesn't work, we can:

1. **Emit custom ProgressUpdateEvent** when tool events are detected
2. **Add client-side tool progress** using `onClientTool` handler
3. **Create custom UI components** for tool visualization

## Current Status

âœ… Event logging added for debugging  
âœ… Tool progress message helper implemented  
âœ… Code ready to automatically show tool progress  
ðŸ”„ Awaiting deployment and testing to verify behavior  

## Expected Result

Users should see:
- Real-time feedback when agent uses tools
- Clear indicators replacing generic "typing..." dots
- Different messages for different tools
- Smooth transition from progress to actual response

**Note:** The logging added is verbose for initial testing. Once we confirm tool visualization works correctly, we can remove or reduce the logging statements.
