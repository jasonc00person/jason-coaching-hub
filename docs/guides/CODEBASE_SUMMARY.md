## 🛠️ Helper Scripts

### Safety Scripts (NEW!)

#### `push-to-staging.sh` ⭐ **USE THIS 99% OF THE TIME**
```bash
./push-to-staging.sh
```
- Automatically switches to `dev` branch
- Commits and pushes to staging
- Shows deployment URLs
- **Safe** - Can't accidentally deploy to production

#### `push-to-production.sh` ⚠️ **DANGEROUS - USE ONLY WHEN TOLD**
```bash
./push-to-production.sh
```
- Requires triple confirmation
- Asks if tested on staging
- Requires typing "DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION"
- Automatically switches back to `dev` after deploy
- **Use with extreme caution**

#### `setup-staging.sh`
```bash
./setup-staging.sh
```
- Creates `dev` branch (already done!)
- Pushes to GitHub
- Shows next steps

### Existing Scripts
- `diagnose-chatkit.sh` - Diagnostic tool for troubleshooting

---

## 🚀 Current Deployment Setup

### Staging Environment (dev branch) ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **Frontend**: https://jason-coaching-hub-git-dev-creator-economy.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://jason-coaching-backend-staging.up.railway.app
- **Auto-deploys**: When pushing to `dev` branch
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly

### Production Environment (main branch) ✅ OPERATIONAL
- **Frontend**: Your main Vercel domain
- **Backend**: https://jason-coaching-backend-production.up.railway.app
- **Auto-deploys**: When pushing to `main` branch
- **Debug Mode**: Disabled
- **Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment

---

## 🎯 The Golden Rules

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Default to `dev` Branch

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Work on `dev` branch
- ✅ Push to `dev` branch
- ✅ Test on staging environment
- ✅ Use `./push-to-staging.sh` for deployments

**NEVER (unless explicitly told):**
- ⛔ Push to `main` branch
- ⛔ Deploy to production without testing
- ⛔ Skip the staging environment
- ⛔ Merge to main without explicit instruction

---

## 📋 Your Daily Workflow

### Step 1: Start Working
```bash
git checkout dev              # Make sure you're on dev
./push-to-staging.sh          # Make changes and push
```

### Step 2: Test
- Open: https://jason-coaching-hub-git-dev-creator-economy.vercel.app
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Check browser console for errors

### Step 3: Deploy to Production (ONLY WHEN TOLD)
```bash
./push-to-production.sh       # Follow the warnings!
```

## 🔐 Security

### Current Safety Measures
- ✅ Separate staging and production environments
- ✅ Debug mode only in staging
- ✅ Triple confirmation for production deploys
- ✅ Automatic branch switching in scripts
- ✅ Clear warnings in documentation

### Environment Isolation
- Staging and production use separate Railway projects
- Different debug modes
- Separate deployment URLs
- Shared vector store (intentional)

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Checking Current Branch
```bash
git branch                        # Shows all branches (* = current)
```

### Quick Status Check
```bash
git status                        # What changed?
git diff                          # Show exact changes
```

### Undo Mistakes
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1           # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1           # Undo last commit (delete changes)
```

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## 📞 Getting Help

### If Something Breaks
1. Check [DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md](DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md) troubleshooting section
2. Check [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for quick fixes
3. Run `./diagnose-chatkit.sh` for diagnostic info
4. Check Vercel/Railway dashboard logs

### Common Issues
- **"Which branch am I on?"** → `git branch`
- **"Changes not deploying?"** → Check Vercel/Railway dashboards
- **"Blank screen?"** → Check browser console for errors
- **"Pushed to wrong branch?"** → See rollback instructions

## ✅ Summary

### What You Have Now
1. ✅ Professional staging/production workflow
2. ✅ Safe deployment scripts with warnings
3. ✅ Comprehensive documentation
4. ✅ Automatic deployment on git push
5. ✅ Protection against accidental production deploys

### What You Should Do
1. **Always use** `./push-to-staging.sh` for deployments
2. **Always test** on staging before production
3. **Never push to main** unless explicitly told
4. **Read** [DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md](DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md) when in doubt

### What's Next
- Continue building features on `dev` branch
- Test everything on staging
- Deploy to production only when explicitly instructed
- Use the helper scripts for all deployments
