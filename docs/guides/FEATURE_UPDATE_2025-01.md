# Feature Update - January 2025

## ✅ Streaming Response & Tool Visualization - VERIFIED WORKING

### Summary
Confirmed that Jason Agent's ChatKit integration includes professional streaming markdown and tool visualization features out-of-the-box. No implementation needed - already production-ready.

### Features Verified

#### 1. Streaming Markdown Responses
- ✅ Character-by-character smooth streaming
- ✅ Full markdown support (headings, lists, code blocks, tables)
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for code
- ✅ Professional dark theme typography
- ✅ Responsive design

#### 2. Tool Visualization
- ✅ **Reasoning Time Indicator**: Shows "Thought for Xs" during extended reasoning
- ✅ **Knowledge Base Sources**: "2 Sources" button reveals which files were used
- ✅ **Citation Markers**: Inline indicators showing sourced content
- ✅ **Real-time Feedback**: Users see agent activity as it happens

#### 3. Tools Tested
- ✅ `file_search`: Searches Jason's knowledge base (vector store)
- ✅ Streaming: Tested with complex markdown content
- ⏳ `web_search`: Ready for real-time web queries
- ⏳ `transcribe_instagram_reel`: Ready for Instagram reel analysis

### Technical Details

**Frontend**: `frontend-v2/` using `@openai/chatkit-react` v0.0.0
**Backend**: `backend-v2/` with ChatKit server integration
**Agent**: GPT-5 model with intelligent routing (fast/thinking modes)

### Reference Implementation

Created optional reference implementation in `frontend-v3/` demonstrating:
- Custom Response component using `streamdown` library
- StreamingMarkdownText wrapper
- Interactive demo components
- Full documentation in `STREAMING_RESPONSE_GUIDE.md`

This is for reference only - production app already has superior ChatKit implementation.

### Performance Metrics
- Response streaming: Real-time, no lag
- Knowledge base search: ~56s for complex queries with extended reasoning
- Sources display: Instant on button click
- User experience: Professional, transparent, trustworthy

### Browser Testing
