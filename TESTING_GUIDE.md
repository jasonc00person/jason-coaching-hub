# Testing Guide - Real-Time Agent Feedback

## What We've Implemented So Far

### Changes Made:
1. **Created `streaming_helpers.py`**: New module with two functions:
   - `stream_with_tool_feedback()` - Basic tool tracking
   - `stream_with_detailed_feedback()` - Detailed event logging

2. **Updated `main.py`**: 
   - Replaced `stream_agent_response()` with `stream_with_detailed_feedback()`
   - This intercepts events and logs tool activity

### What You Should See:

When you ask a question that triggers file_search, the backend logs will show:

```
================================================================================
ü§ñ AGENT ACTIVITY STREAM
================================================================================

[Event #1] RunItemCreated
  ‚îî‚îÄ type: run.item.created

[Event #2] ToolCallCreated
  ‚îî‚îÄ type: tool.call.created
  ‚îî‚îÄ name: file_search

üìÅ Using file_search...

[Event #3] ToolCallCompleted
  ‚îî‚îÄ type: tool.call.completed

[Event #4-N] TextChunkEvents (the actual response)
  ‚îî‚îÄ delta: "Here are the hook templates..."

================================================================================
‚úÖ Processed XX events total
================================================================================
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend-v2
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Watch for:
- "INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000"
- No startup errors

### 2. Open Your Frontend
Either:
- Go to your deployed Vercel site
- Or run locally: `cd frontend-v2 && npm run dev`

### 3. Test Questions

**For File Search (Already Enabled):**
- "What hook templates do you have?"
- "Tell me about your ICP framework"
- "What's in your knowledge base?"

**What to Look For:**
- Backend terminal shows the event stream with tool names
- Frontend still works normally (no breaking changes)
- Response quality is unchanged

### 4. Check Backend Logs

You should see detailed event information showing:
- Event count
- Event types
- Tool names when tools are called
- Icons (üìÅ for file_search)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Event interception and logging
- Detailed debugging output in backend
- All existing functionality preserved

### ‚è≥ What's Next:
- Enable web_search tool
- Emit actual ChatKit status events (not just logs)
- Show status in frontend UI
- Add polish (timing, better icons, error handling)

## Troubleshooting

### If Backend Won't Start:
```bash
# Check Python version
python3 --version  # Should be 3.9+

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### If No Events Show:
- Make sure you're watching the terminal where uvicorn is running
- Try asking a question that requires file_search
- Check that JASON_VECTOR_STORE_ID is set

### If Frontend Breaks:
- The changes are backend-only so far
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API URL is correct in frontend config

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm the event logging is working:

1. **Add ChatKit Status Events**: Make the status visible in UI
2. **Enable Web Search**: Add web_search back to tools
3. **Polish**: Add timing, better formatting, error handling
