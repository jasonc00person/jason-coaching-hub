# Deployment Testing Plan

## Current Situation

✅ **What We've Implemented:**
1. Created `streaming_helpers.py` with event logging
2. Integrated detailed feedback into `main.py`
3. Added Python 3.9 compatibility fixes

❌ **Local Testing Blocked By:**
- `chatkit` module not publicly available yet (placeholder package)
- Python 3.9 compatibility issues with `openai-agents`
- Your prod environment (Railway) has these sorted out

## Solution: Test in Production

Since your Railway deployment is already working, let's deploy our changes there:

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add backend-v2/app/streaming_helpers.py
git add backend-v2/app/main.py
git commit -m "Add real-time agent tool feedback"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Auto-Deploys
Railway will automatically deploy when you push to `main` branch.

### Step 3: Monitor Railway Logs
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Select your backend project
3. Click on "Deployments" → Latest deployment
4. Watch the logs for our debug output

### Step 4: Test in Production
1. Go to https://jason-coaching-hub.vercel.app/
2. Ask a question that triggers file_search: "What hook templates do you have?"
3. Check Railway logs - you should see:

```
================================================================================
🤖 AGENT ACTIVITY STREAM
================================================================================

[Event #1] RunItemCreated
[Event #2] ToolCallCreated
  └─ name: file_search
📁 Using file_search...
...
================================================================================
```

## What to Look For

### In Railway Logs:
- `🤖 AGENT ACTIVITY STREAM` header
- Event count and types
- Tool names (file_search)
- Icons (📁, 🌐, etc.)

### In Frontend:
- Everything should still work normally
- No breaking changes
- Responses come through as before

## Next Steps After Confirmation

Once we confirm the event logging works in production:
1. ✅ Enable web_search tool
2. ✅ Convert log messages to actual ChatKit status events
3. ✅ Frontend will show real-time tool indicators
4. ✅ Polish (timing, better formatting)

## Rollback if Needed

If something breaks:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy the previous working version.
