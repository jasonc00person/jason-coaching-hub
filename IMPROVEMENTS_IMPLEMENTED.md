# ‚úÖ Top 5 Improvements Implemented

## What We Just Added to `jason_agent.py`

Based on analyzing production system prompts from Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, Perplexity, v0, GitHub Copilot, and Bolt.new, here's what was implemented:

---

## 1. üéØ TOOL USAGE PROTOCOL (CRITICAL - Biggest Impact)

### Before:
```
"Use the File Search tool to search these files whenever users ask about..."
"Use web search when..."
```

### After:
**60+ lines** of detailed tool usage instructions including:

- **Clear decision tree**: "BEFORE answering ANY question, ask yourself: 'Could this be in my coaching materials?'"
- **Mandatory search triggers**: Explicit list of when File Search is required
- **Search strategy**: 4-step process for how to search effectively
- **Response priority order**: Numbered 1-4 priority system
- **What NOT to do**: Clear ‚ùå markers for when NOT to use each tool
- **Fallback behavior**: Exact language to use when search fails

**Impact**: Agent will now search knowledge base MUCH more consistently and know exactly when to use web search vs file search.

---

## 2. üÜî IDENTITY & CONTEXT (Foundation)

### Added:
```markdown
KNOWLEDGE CUTOFF: Your training data is current as of April 2024.
When asked about events after this date, acknowledge the limitation naturally 
and use Web Search to get current information.
```

**Why**: Claude, ChatGPT, and Perplexity ALL have this. Manages expectations and prevents hallucination.

**Impact**: Agent will gracefully handle questions about current events and know to use web search.

---

## 3. üìö SOURCE ATTRIBUTION (Trust Builder)

### Added:
Clear citation standards with specific examples:

**When using knowledge base:**
- ‚úÖ "Based on the Hook Template Framework from the course materials..."
- ‚úÖ "I pulled the ICP worksheet from the knowledge base..."

**When using web search:**
- ‚úÖ "According to recent TikTok algorithm updates..."
- ‚úÖ "I just searched and found that..."

**When using general expertise:**
- ‚úÖ "From my experience with viral content..."

**Why**: Perplexity built their brand on citations. Users trust agents more when they know the source.

**Impact**: Builds trust, makes it clear where advice comes from.

---

## 4. üß† THINKING PROTOCOL (Quality Improver)

### Added:
```markdown
## Think Before Responding

For EVERY user question, mentally process:
1. What is the user REALLY asking for?
2. Do I need to search my knowledge base for specific templates/frameworks?
3. Is this about current trends that happened after April 2024?
4. What's the most actionable, specific advice I can give?
```

Plus specific thinking frameworks for:
- Strategy questions (step-by-step consideration)
- Template requests (search ‚Üí customize ‚Üí apply)
- Creative/brainstorming (multiple options with rationale)

**Why**: v0, Bolt.new, and Claude all have "think before responding" protocols. Dramatically improves response quality.

**Impact**: More thoughtful, contextualized responses instead of just pattern-matching.

---

## 5. üìê OUTPUT FORMATTING STANDARDS (UX Improver)

### Added structured formats for:

**Template/Framework Requests:**
1. Brief intro
2. Template structure
3. Customized example
4. Actionable next steps

**Strategy Questions:**
- Lead with core insight
- Numbered steps
- Short paragraphs
- Bold key points
- End with action

**Script Writing:**
- Hook (0:00-0:03) with timing
- Pattern interrupt
- Value delivery
- CTA

**Feedback/Reviews:**
- What's working
- What to improve
- Priority order

**Why**: Every production prompt has detailed formatting. Claude has 20+ lines on markdown.

**Impact**: Consistent, scannable, actionable responses.

---

## üéÅ BONUS: Enhanced Voice Consistency

Also added explicit "NEVER say" rules:

‚ùå "Let's dive into..." (too corporate)
‚ùå "I'd be happy to help you..." (too formal)
‚ùå "As an AI language model..." (breaks character)
‚ùå "I hope this helps!" (generic)

Plus:
- Opening variation examples
- Energy matching rules
- Better ending strategies

**Why**: Anthropic has a whole section listing phrases to avoid. Prevents model from defaulting to generic AI-speak.

---

## üìä Expected Impact

### Immediate improvements:
1. **More knowledge base searches** - Agent will search course materials much more consistently
2. **Better tool selection** - Clear rules prevent using wrong tool
3. **Cited responses** - Users will know where info comes from
4. **More thoughtful answers** - Thinking protocol improves quality
5. **Consistent formatting** - Responses will be more scannable and actionable

### Metrics to watch:
- File Search tool usage should increase significantly
- More "Based on course materials..." responses
- More structured/formatted responses
- Better handling of current events (with web search)

---

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

Test with these types of questions:

1. **Template requests**: "Give me a hook template"
   - Should search knowledge base and cite it
   
2. **Current events**: "What's trending on TikTok right now?"
   - Should use web search and cite it
   
3. **Strategy questions**: "How do I grow my Instagram?"
   - Should think step-by-step and ask for context if needed
   
4. **Mixed questions**: "How do I use your ICP framework for current trends?"
   - Should use BOTH file search and web search appropriately

---

## üìà What's Different from Production Prompts Now?

### We now match production quality on:
‚úÖ Tool usage clarity (like Cursor)
‚úÖ Knowledge cutoff handling (like Claude/ChatGPT)
‚úÖ Citation standards (like Perplexity)
‚úÖ Thinking protocols (like v0/Bolt.new)
‚úÖ Output formatting (like all of them)
‚úÖ Voice consistency (better than most!)

### Still could add (Phase 2):
- Dynamic temperature based on request type
- More sophisticated conversation state tracking
- Multimodal handling (if you add images later)
- Session memory/personalization

But these 5 improvements put your agent on par with production-grade assistants.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test it**: Try asking for templates, current trends, and strategies
2. **Monitor**: Watch how often it searches knowledge base vs web
3. **Iterate**: See what works, what doesn't
4. **Add phase 2**: If these work well, implement remaining improvements from AGENT_IMPROVEMENTS.md

The prompt went from ~100 lines to ~250 lines, putting it in the same ballpark as production prompts (Claude's is ~160 lines, Cursor's is ~270 lines).
