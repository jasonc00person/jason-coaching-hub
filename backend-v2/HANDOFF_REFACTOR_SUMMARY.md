# Agent Handoff System Refactor - Summary

## What Changed

Replaced custom routing logic with OpenAI's native agent handoff system for cleaner, more maintainable code.

### Before (Custom Routing)
```python
# Manual routing logic with regex and keyword matching
def select_agent_for_query(message: str) -> Agent:
    if complex_query:
        return jason_agent_full  # gpt-5
    else:
        return jason_agent_mini  # gpt-5-mini
```

### After (Handoff System)
```python
# Automatic routing via triage agent
triage_agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    handoffs=[quick_response_agent, strategy_agent]
)
```

## New Architecture

```
User Message → Triage Agent (gpt-5-mini)
                    ↓
    ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
    ↓                               ↓
Quick Response Agent        Strategy Agent
(gpt-5-mini, 0 tools)      (gpt-5, 2 tools)
```

### Triage Agent
- **Model**: gpt-5-mini
- **Purpose**: Routing only (dirt cheap)
- **Tools**: None
- **Handoffs**: Quick Response + Strategy

### Quick Response Agent
- **Model**: gpt-5-mini
- **Purpose**: Simple questions, greetings, casual chat
- **Tools**: None (ultra-fast)
- **Instructions**: Emphasizes brevity (1-2 sentences)

### Strategy Agent
- **Model**: gpt-5
- **Purpose**: Complex strategy, templates, web search, image analysis
- **Tools**: File search + Web search
- **Instructions**: Allows depth when needed

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend-v2/app/jason_agent.py`
- ✅ Created three instruction variants: `TRIAGE_INSTRUCTIONS`, `QUICK_RESPONSE_INSTRUCTIONS`, `STRATEGY_INSTRUCTIONS`
- ✅ Created three agents: `triage_agent`, `quick_response_agent`, `strategy_agent`
- ✅ Removed legacy: `jason_agent_full`, `jason_agent_mini`, `select_agent_for_query()`
- ✅ Removed unused `re` import
- ✅ Main export: `jason_agent = triage_agent`

### 2. `backend-v2/app/main.py`
- ✅ Removed import: `select_agent_for_query`
- ✅ Removed routing logic: Lines that called `select_agent_for_query()`
- ✅ Updated to use: `self.assistant` (which is now triage agent)
- ✅ Updated API info endpoint to mention handoffs

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Code**: ~50 lines of custom routing logic deleted
2. **SDK Native**: Uses OpenAI's built-in handoff mechanism
3. **Better Tracing**: Handoffs visible in OpenAI dashboard
4. **Cost Optimized**: Triage overhead is minimal (gpt-5-mini routing only)
5. **Maintainable**: Routing logic in prompt, not code
6. **Automatic Session Management**: SDK handles context across handoffs

## How to Test

### Manual Testing (when server is running)

1. **Test Quick Response routing** (should use gpt-5-mini):
   ```
   "yo what's up"
   "hey"
   "what's good bro"
   ```

2. **Test Strategy routing** (should use gpt-5):
   ```
   "show me your hook template"
   "what's trending on TikTok right now"
   "help me create a content strategy"
   "how do I build a funnel?"
   ```

3. **Test image analysis** (should route to Strategy):
   - Upload an image/screenshot
   - Triage should recognize it needs tools → Strategy agent

### Expected Console Output

Look for logs like:
```
[Handoff System] Processing query: 'yo what's up...'
```

Instead of the old:
```
[Routing] Using GPT-5 Mini for query: 'yo what's up...'
```

### Verify Handoffs in OpenAI Dashboard

If tracing is enabled, you should see:
- Triage Agent → Quick Response Agent (for simple queries)
- Triage Agent → Strategy Agent (for complex queries)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the legacy `JASON_INSTRUCTIONS` is still available as a fallback. You could temporarily revert to:

```python
jason_agent = Agent[AgentContext](
    model="gpt-5",
    name="Jason Cooperson",
    instructions=JASON_INSTRUCTIONS,
    tools=[build_file_search_tool(), build_web_search_tool()],
)
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add handoff descriptions**: Enhance routing by adding explicit `handoff_description` to specialist agents
2. **Monitor routing accuracy**: Track which queries go where
3. **Fine-tune triage instructions**: Adjust routing logic based on real usage
4. **Add more specialists**: Could add specialized agents for scripts, funnels, etc.

## Code Quality

- ✅ No linter errors introduced
- ✅ Removed unused imports (`re`)
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility (same public API)
- ✅ Added clear comments and documentation
- ✅ Followed existing code style

**Refactored by**: Agent Builder Demo
**Date**: October 2025
**Lines removed**: ~50 (routing logic)
**Lines added**: ~30 (agent definitions)
**Net change**: Simpler, cleaner, more maintainable
